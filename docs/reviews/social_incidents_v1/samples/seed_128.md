=== BELIEFS ===
Kemar Gate (f_01; knowledge=):
  [t_root_f_01; confidence 0.62; legitimacy] Our recorded formation was direct_successor. We define ourselves as a community formed after the old order failed. Records, offices and shared procedures hold us together. We survive by limiting obligations beyond our own boundaries.
    reference_scope=event | evidence={}
  [h_pressure; confidence 0.39; interpretation] Regional records remembered a veiled sky and unusual exposure. We accept that local record, but not later stories that turn it into a complete explanation of the age; for us it marks a test of obligations that endured.
    reference_scope=event | evidence={}
  [h_relation_2; confidence 0.64; interpretation] That recorded agreement increased trust at the time. We do not read later intentions back into that record.
    reference_scope=event | evidence={"a":"f_01","b":"f_08","delta":34}
  [; confidence 0.43; interpretation] For now, the available evidence says our dealings are cooperative; we do not treat that as permanent.
    reference_scope=present | evidence={"a":"f_01","b":"f_08","score":34}
Tomon Gate (f_02; knowledge=):
  [t_step_00; confidence 0.46; legitimacy] Our recorded formation was newcomer_formation. We entered this region outside the old local political lineage. Shared rites give the community continuity. We change inherited practice when survival requires it.
    reference_scope=event | evidence={}
  [h_pressure; confidence 0.58; interpretation] Regional records remembered a veiled sky and unusual exposure. Whatever larger story people tell, our tradition remembers it as a warning against repeating old mistakes.
    reference_scope=event | evidence={}

Dasil Ruin (f_04; knowledge=):
  [t_step_01; confidence 0.69; legitimacy] Our recorded formation was fragmentation. We inherited older obligations, but not the right to reproduce the old order unchanged. Household ties are what bind us. We change inherited practice when survival requires it.

Todor Well (f_07; knowledge=):
