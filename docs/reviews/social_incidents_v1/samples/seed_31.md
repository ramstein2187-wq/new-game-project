=== BELIEFS ===
Kelen Reach (f_00; knowledge=):
  [t_root_f_00; confidence 0.66; legitimacy] Our recorded formation was enclave_continuity. We inherited older obligations, but not the right to reproduce the old order unchanged. Shared work and maintenance hold us together. We measure continuity by what we can restore.
    reference_scope=event | evidence={}
  [h_pressure; confidence 0.90; interpretation] Regional records remembered a veiled sky and unusual exposure. We accept that local record, but not later stories that turn it into a complete explanation of the age; for us it marks a point from which later generations learned to rebuild.

Lura Well (f_02; knowledge=):
